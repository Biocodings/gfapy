- follow the example of the work on Alignment for the rest of the library
-- write a manual
-- write api tests
-- write internals tests
-- check documentation
- simplify validation levels to 4 instead of 6:
-- :off  => no validation (such as 0)
-- :r    => guarantees that valid GFA is read (such as 3) *default*
-- :rw   => guarantees that valid GFA is read and written (such as 4)
-- :full => guarantees that the internal state is always valid (such as 5)
- use paths/groups instead of SegmentEndPaths
- write complicated/long tests using data in a separate repo
