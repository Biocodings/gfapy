# RGFA

RGFA is a Ruby library for working with GFA files. It allows to parse,
validate, edit and write GFA files.

This manual explains how to access the information in GFA files using the
library. It is completed by the more technical API library, which documents
each class, method and constant defined by the library.

A test suite makes sure that the functionality described by this manual also
works as intented. However, if this is not the case, please report any bug
using the Github issues tracked (https://github.com/ggonnella/rgfa/issues).

## GFA specifications

The library is based on the official GFA specifications version
1 and 2, available at https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec.
See the Versions chapter for an overview of the differences of the two versions
and methods for the conversion from one version to the other.
