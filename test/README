test_api # => test of API public methods
test_internals # => test of some non-public methods
test_unit # => unit tests for some modules

Not all modules have unit tests, as in some cases everything is tested
by test_api, in some other cases by test_api plus test_internals.
If this is not the case, then test_unit are present.
